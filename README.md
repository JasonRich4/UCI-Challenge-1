# <UCI Challenge 1>

## Description


- The main objective and general focus of this project was to read, analyze, restructure, and ultimately improve existing code.
- I learned how to eyeball repetative code and group classes together to reduce redundancy. A fundemental mentality in programming known as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself.)


## Installation


To install:
- Create a new directory within your local machine, this can be done by simple creating a new folder through windows explorer or through git commands like "mkdir your-new-directory"
- Find and copy the SSH code on github (https://github.com/JasonRich4/UCI-Challenge-1)
- Clone the repository into the new directory via git commands "git clone https://github.com/JasonRich4/UCI-Challenge-1.git"
- Open with your choice of source-code editor
- Enjoy!
